        <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
        <p>
          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup
          language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure
          of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building
          blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web
          pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what
          CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms
          about the language.

        <summary>What is JS?</summary>
        <p>
          Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we
          will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as
          "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are
          comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.

        <summary>What is Jquery?</summary>
        <p>
          jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
          The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on
          your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many
          lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods
          that you can call with a single line of code. jQuery also simplifies a
          lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM
          manipulation.

        <summary>Angular VS React</summary>
        <p>
          Choosing the right JavaScript frameworks is a real confusion.
          Especially when you have a lot of options that are super resourceful
          and capable of facilitating the project requirements. But choosing the
          one for the right set of projects demands knowledge of several
          critical aspects. We have covered some of the essential points in this
          post by making a fair comparison of Angular vs React. Some say
          comparing Angular and React is like comparing apples to oranges.
          Angular is a JavaScript framework built using TypeScript, while React
          is a JavaScript library built using JSX. Add a few libraries to React,
          and you can turn it into a complete framework. But the resulting stack
          workflow is still very different from Angular, so the comparability is
          limited. On the other hand, both React and Angular have
          component-based architecture, resulting in both having reusable and
          modular elements aiming to solve similar front-end problems. And thus,
          there is a never-ending debate on Angular vs React in the development
          community. So, which one is better? This article gives an in-depth
          comparison of Angular and React based on various factors to help you
          analyze which is best suited for your project.

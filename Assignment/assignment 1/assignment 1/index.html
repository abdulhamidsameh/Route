              Colombian Juan Carlos Osorio, coach of the first football team at
              Zamalek Club, confirmed that the cup matches in all countries of
              the world serve as an opportunity for the teams that participate
              in the second division leagues to present strong matches. The
              coach explained in the press conference for the match that he
              studied the opponent well, and that he did not reduce his size,
              adding that he pushed a formation of young players, and gave the
              opportunity to others, such as Samson, Mahmoud Shabana and Youssef
              Osama Nabih. Osorio said: “The adjustments made by the coaching
              staff between the two halves contributed to improving the team’s
              level, and there were individual errors in the match that caused
              Zamalek to concede goals.”
